            The W3C Advisory Committee has nominated nine individuals, and is invited today to vote until 1 June 2023 for six seats in the W3C Advisory Board (AB) election. Please, read the statements of the nominees.
    
    Created in March 1998, the Advisory Board provides ongoing guidance to the W3C Team on issues of strategy, management, legal matters, process, and conflict resolution. The Advisory Board also serves the W3C Members by tracking issues raised between Advisory Committee meetings, soliciting Member comments on such issues, and proposing actions to resolve these issues.
